 This includes the codes and final report of the course of "Data analysis and reporting".

A venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a blood clot that forms within a vein and is a condition that can be fatal. This project was to identify clinical risk factors associated with increased risk of subsequent VTE episode or death in those who have experienced VTE is important for improving treatment choices. 

And there were four questions related with this project:

1)   Is there evidence that the risk of VTE recurrence or death in the year after incident VTE differs by sex?
2)   2)   What role, if any, does menopausal status play in differences in risk by sex? 
3)   3)   Develop and assess a prognostic model to predict whether individuals will experience VTE recurrence or death within one year after an incident VTE. 
4)   4)   Does the prognostic model accurately identify high risk individuals in the extension cohort?
